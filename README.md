Raku Layout Example
====================

Raku layout for iOS projects example.

The project include three targets:

RakuLayoutExample: Runs the app
RakuLayoutExampleTests: Functionality Tests with SenTestingKit. Press &#8984; + U to run them.
RakuLayoutExample copy (I couldn't change the name): Runs the Integration Tests that use KIF to test the UI. You  need to have the Accessibility Inspector turned on in your simulator. You can enable it in Settings - General - Accesibility
